# Harry-Potter-Sorting-Hat-Quiz

The Harry Potter Sorting Hat Quiz is a fun online quiz that asks a series of personality questions to determine which Hogwarts house the user belongs to: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. The quiz is based on the Sorting Hat ceremony that takes place at the beginning of every school year in the Harry Potter books and movies. The quiz questions are designed to determine the user's personality traits and values, which are then used to assign points to each house. At the end of the quiz, the user is assigned to the house with the highest point total, and is given a description of the house's characteristics and values. The Harry Potter Sorting Hat Quiz is a fun way for fans of the Harry Potter series to immerse themselves in the magical world of Hogwarts and discover which house they would belong to if they were students at the school.
